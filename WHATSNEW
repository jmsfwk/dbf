What's New
==========

0.93.010
--------
    Table now returns a closed database; .open() must now be called before
    accessing the records.
    Note: fields, number of records, table type, and other metadata is
    available on closed tables.

    Finished adding support for 'F' (aka 'N') field types in dBase III tables;
    this is a practicality beats purity issue as the F type is not part of the
    db3 standard, but is exactly the same as N and other programs will use it
    instead of N when creating db3 tables.

0.93.000
--------
    PEP 8 changes (yo --> self, someMethod --> some_method)

0.92.002
--------
    added more support for the Null type in the other custome data types

0.91.001
--------
    Removed __del__ from dbf records; consequently they no longer autosave when
    going out of scope.  Either call .write_record() explicitly, or use the new
    Write iterator which will call .write_record for you.

    Finished adding Null support (not supported in db3 tables)
